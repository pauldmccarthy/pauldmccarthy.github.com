Today I walked up Mihiwaka and Mount Kettle, two hills near Port
Chalmers. There were some fun rock scrambles up to the top of Mihiwaka, and
good views from the top of the Otago Peninsula, Port Chalmers, and the Rock
and Pillars. There was a bit of scrub bashing around Cedar Farm Reservior, and
my knee got ripped up by some stinging nettle, but it was all in good
fun. Mount Kettle was a nice climb, but a bit overgrown at the top to allow
for good views.
