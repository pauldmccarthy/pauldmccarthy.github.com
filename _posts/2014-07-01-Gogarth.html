<p>A short and exciting mid-week trip to Gogarth, a massive sea cliff just off
Anglesey, in North Wales. On Monday night we drove from Oxford to
a <a href="http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/venues/ynyws/">lovely hut</a> in the
mountains near Llanberis. Then on Tuesday we drove out to Holy Island.</p>

<p>The day began with an exciting descent down to the base of the cliff - this
was far more dangerous than the climb itself, involving sketchy traverses
across steep vegetated slopes with occasional steps across voids, and a little
bit of down-climbing on loose rock once we were nearer to the sea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=4297">The climb</a>
itself was reasonably straightforward for the most part - I felt that the
first four pitches were very easy for the grade (particularly given my
experiences at
<a href="http://pauldmccarthy.github.io/2014/06/23/swanage/">Swanage</a> the
previous week). The top pitch (which I seconded - easing my way into the E
grades) was well worth the amble up though - hard, well protected moves on
great rock, in a spectacular setting.</p>

<p>On the way back to Oxford on Tuesday night we treated ourselves to a
traditional (?!) Welsh dish - chicken curry on chips. As good as it
sounds, maybe even better!</p>
