I literally found Mt Domett via a random search on
http://www.topomap.co.nz/. I was looking for something high (i.e. covered with
snow), not too steep (no avalanche danger), close to the road and not too far
from Dunedin (achievable in a day). The location and topography looked
perfect. so I sent an email out, looking for people to with whom to share the
ride and the trip. I later found out that Mt Domett is a reasonably popular
tramping peak, with the route I'd picked being one of the common
approaches. Hey, I know how to read a map; good for me. 


The day started innocently enough ... and actually ended the same way. A
perfect peak for a day trip. We left Dunedin at 7am, had a coffee stop in
Oamaru, and hit the trail at 9:15. We made it up to the slightly-but-not-much
smaller Little Domett at about 2pm via a leisurely walk on 4WD tracks, through
snowgrass, and about an hour of snowshoeing. I was all for heading on to the
slightly bigger Mount Domett, but common sense, and the beer that we'd stashed
in a stream near the car, enticed us back down for a sensibly early 7:30pm
return to Dunedin. Great trip with a great group of people.
