Despite having lived in Hobart for 3 years, I'd never visited Wellington Falls, one of the more popular walks in Wellington Park. I decided to rectify this today.  I'd left my bike at work on friday night, the result of a few too many beers after work. So I went and picked it up, and took the lazy option of parking my car near the Fern Tree Tavern, saving myself a 10 km slog up Summerleas Road from home.  The pipeline track is a fairly boring ride, so I pushed pretty hard, making it to the start of the Wellington Falls track in about 35 minutes. The weather was perfect, and the walk to the falls was pleasant, although a bit steeper than I'd expected.  I got some good views of Cathedral Rock and Montague Thumbs, although the trees prevented me from getting a 'perfect' shot. The official falls lookout provided some stunning views across the valley, but I was a bit disappointed with the distance from the lookout to the falls.  I knew that there was a track which crossed the falls higher up, so I continued along the main track to find it. After walking for about 5 minutes, I decided that I'd overshot the turnoff, so back tracked, and found an inconspicuous cairn marking the track to the falls. This track was quite enjoyable, involving some scrambling and, closer to the falls, bouldering.  I wasn't disappointed, as I was able to stand at the top of the falls and look into the valley. Unfortunately, I don't think any of my photos captured the scene well enough.
