For the second weekend in a row, I was enjoying fresh powder at Awakino
skifield; this time however, I was on an introductory mountaineering course. I
had a great time, learning the basics of crampon and ice axe use, self
arresting, and avalanche awareness (check out the second picture - that
occurred some time on saturday night). We spent sunday climbing up to Fosters
peak, but the gale force winds prevented us from making it all the way to the
top.
