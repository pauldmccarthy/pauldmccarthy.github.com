I've been injured for several months now (rotator cuff), so haven't been doing
much.  But the shoulder is slowly improving, so I couldn't resist visiting
Fontainebleau while on a work trip to Paris. Cycling through the forest on
quiet roads, and following dots and arrows through a boulder field. Pure
bliss.
