Yesterday I went for a ride with one of my new flatmates Nathan, to get a bit of training in for the contact epic, in 3 weeks. The ride took us from home in Waldronville, around the west of Saddle Hill to Outram, then back down to Mosgiel, and across the eastern face of Saddle back to Waldronville. A nice 45 km loop with good views; what more could you ask for on a saturday morning!
