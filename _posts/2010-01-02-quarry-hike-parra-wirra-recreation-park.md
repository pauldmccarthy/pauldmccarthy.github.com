Today I went for a drive to Parra Wirra Recreation Park, about 30 km North
East of Adelaide. I walked for about 4 hours in pleasant weather (about 25
degrees) through typical Aussie scrub, and through a 19th century gold mining
area.  Devil's Nose, an unplanned diversion, was the highlight of the walk
offering a gorgeous panorama over yellow grassy hills. Another highlight was
the appearance of a couple of emus as I was driving out of the park.
