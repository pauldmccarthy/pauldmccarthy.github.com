Yesterday, in ridiculously hot conditions, I competed in the Otago Peninsula
Challenge (http://otagopeninsulachallenge.co.nz), a 43km mountain bike race
near Dunedin. It was 28 degrees when I got up at 7am, and reached 35 before
midday, before a blissful Southerly cooled the air down.  When I entered a
couple of weeks before, I thought '43km? phht, no problems'. It turned out to
be a lot tougher than I'd anticipated. Most of the hills were unrideable (for
me anyway), and I struggled pushing my bike up with blisters on both of my
heels from my previous weekend in the Rockburn.  Not that I'm using that as an
excuse - I've got the heat, and an early onset of mild Hyponatremia (cheers,
Ben) as perfectly good excuses. Oh, and maybe the fact that I didn't train at
all. Whatever.


In the end I was quite happy with my performance, finishing in 3:34, placing
32/60 in the open men's, and 71/261 overall. I was blown away with the scenery
- I've not spent much time exploring the Peninsula since moving to Dunedin;
Victory Beach and the Pyramids were amazing, and I'll certainly be heading
back to check them out properly.  I still haven't bought a replacement camera,
and the few photos I took with my mobile phone turned out rubbish; there's a
few albums up on Flickr though (source of the two photos below -
