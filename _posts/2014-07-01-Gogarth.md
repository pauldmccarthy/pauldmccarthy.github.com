A short and exciting mid-week trip to Gogarth, a massive sea cliff just off
Anglesey, in North Wales. On Monday night we drove from Oxford to
a <a href="http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/venues/ynyws/">lovely hut</a> in the
mountains near Llanberis. Then on Tuesday we drove out to Holy Island.


The day began with an exciting descent down to the base of the cliff - this
was far more dangerous than the climb itself, involving sketchy traverses
across steep vegetated slopes with occasional steps across voids, and a little
bit of down-climbing on loose rock once we were nearer to the sea.


<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=4297">The climb</a>, while
definitely not for beginners, was straightforward for the most part - I felt
that the first four pitches were very easy for the grade (particularly given
my experiences at [Swanage]({% post_url 2014-06-23-swanage %}) the previous
week). The top pitch (which I seconded - easing my way into the E grades) was
well worth the amble up though - hard, well protected moves on great rock, in
a spectacular setting.


On the way back to Oxford on Tuesday night we treated ourselves to a
traditional (?!) Welsh dish - chicken curry on chips. As good as it
sounds, maybe even better!
