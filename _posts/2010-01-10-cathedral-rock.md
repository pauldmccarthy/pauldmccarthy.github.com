Today I did the Cathedral Rock track. I decided against continuing on to
Montagu Thumbs and Wellington Falls for a number of reasons, including being
slightly hungover, and (related) starting the walk too late in the
day. Nevertheless, the walk took about 4 hours.


Cathedral Rock is a stunning outcrop about 20 km south west of Hobart in the
Wellington Ranges, about 880 metres above sea level. The first section of the
walk was a moderate climb along a disused fire trail. The trail passes through
reasonably thick forest, so there's not much to look at; occasional glimpses
of Cathedral Rock are the only highlights until the Cathedral Rock track
junction.


The walk became much more entertaining here, involving about 45 minutes of
steep climbing and some scrambling straight up to the Cathedral Rock
summit. The views frop the top were breathtaking, with the perfect weather (25
degrees, no clouds or wind) adding to the experience.  I decided to walk along
the North West Bay River to get back to the car park, for a bit of variation,
but it took longer than I'd hoped (almost an hour of rock hopping), and I was
glad when the car park came into sight.
