I had a great day trip to Swanage on sunday with a friend, Rob. We ticked off
a <a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=14747">couple</a> of <a
href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=14762">classic</a> E1s, and
finished the day by climbing the amazing <a
href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=14736">Tudor Rose</a> - my
first E2!


The first pitch involved a *big* traverse above a very moody sea.  Some of the
moves were hard - I think about Oz grade 21 (I may have been a bit off-route
at a few points, thus inadvertently making it harder for myself), and the
slightly spaced gear made the climb very atmospheric, causing me to pause
several times before committing to a few sections. But I got to the first
belay ledge safely, and then we were treated to an easier, but brilliant
second pitch to cap off a great day's climbing.
