<p>I had a great couple of days hiking and climbing in the Darrans with my
friend Tim. The Darrans, in Fiordland, are sort of NZ's version of Yosemite,
with big walls and great rock. It is very much a wild, alpine environment
however, with long approaches, snow fields and glaciers, dense vegetation, and
unpredictable weather.  </p>

<p>On the first day we went for an adventurous hike on a classic loop from
Homer Hut, heading up Talbot's Ladder, across to Traverse Pass, and down to
Gertrude Saddle, then back out to the hut. The second day saw us baking in the
sun on a multi-pitch sport climb at Shotwell Slabs. It's supposedly fully
bolted, although you should expect the odd 10 metre run-out between bolts! The
same goes for the Chasm, a sport climbing crag near Milford Sound which we
visited the next day; we decided to bail on a 'sport' climb due to an
unreasonably long runout about half way up. Next time I'll take a few cams
with me ...</p>
