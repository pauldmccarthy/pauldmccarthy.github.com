A couple of weeks back I went on a climbing trip with a few friends to the
Anti-Atlas mountains, in Morocco. We stayed at the <a
href="http://www.tizourgane-kasbah.com/guest-house/the-auberge.html">Kasbah-Tizourgane</a>,
a village-fortress from the 13th century which has been turned into a guest
house - an amazing location!


I had wanted to visit Morocco for several years, having been told stories
about endless views of Arapiles-quality quartzite. There is certainly an
enormous quantity of rock in the anti-atlas, although the quality is quite
variable - it's definitely an adventure trad destination.


While I had a great time climbing with Juilan, Mick and Roger, for me the best
part of this trip was simply being able to spend time in such a quiet, relaxed
and friendly part of the world. Friendly people, an almost complete absence of
cars, goats in trees (thanks to Julian for that picture) .. and loads of great
climbing. What more could you ask for?
