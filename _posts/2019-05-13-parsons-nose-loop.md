Stopped working about 15:15, started running about 16:00.

Ran up the Cwm Glas Mawr, and scrambled up the true left of the falls. Topped
out for a glorious view of Parson's Nose and the Clogwyn y Person arete.

Put my climbing shoes on and scrambled up the arete left of the Parson's Nose
West Gully[^1], then on to the main arete above.

Topped out, then ran across Crib-y-Ddysgl, then down Gyrn Las and back to the
car (and then on to Oxford).

A great afternoon jaunt in the beautiful May sunshine.

[^1]: Amazing little scramble which I would put at the upper limit of grade 3
      scrambling (and would possibly call it _climbing_ rather than
      _scrambling_). I'd also strongly recommend climbing shoes, and possibly
      the use of a rope!
