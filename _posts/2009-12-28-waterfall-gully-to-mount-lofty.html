I figured that I needed to do some exercise to minimise the impact that
Christmas holiday indulgence would do to my health. So this morning I decided
to walk from Waterfall Gully, in Rostrevor, to the Mount Lofty summit.


Mount Lofty is the highest point (I think) in Adelaide, at 710 metres above
sea level. Considering that it was about 34 degrees Celsius, I found it hard
to believe that it can actually snow there in winter. The walk from Waterfall
Gully was a reasonably easy 4 km walk, with some steep sections. I managed to
make it to the top in an hour, which included a few photo stops at the
waterfalls, and a few minutes admiring a kangaroo and her joey, which happened
to be foraging near the track.  After a few minutes admiring the view and
taking some panorama shots, I made my way back down. For no particular reason,
I decided to jog down, so made it back in about 25 minutes.
