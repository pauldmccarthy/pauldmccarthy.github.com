A few weeks ago I decided to ride from Deloraine to Liffey Falls, a 60 km return trip in central Tasmania. The ride route can be found at  http://www.greatwesterntiers.net.au/content/great-world-heritage-ride  A good place to park the car is outside the Online Access Centre, just left after you cross the bridge.  Riversdale road is suitable only for mountain bikes or hybrids. Additionally, the first section of Highland Lakes road, coming out of Deloraine, is currently being resealed, which would cause problems for roadies.  No bikes allowed on the walking track from the Liffey Falls carpark to the falls itself, although it is an easy ride. There are a few steps near the end, and you'll want to watch out for walkers.
