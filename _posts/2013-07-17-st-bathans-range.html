<p>On the weekend I headed up to the St Bathans range with a few friends. We
  had originally planned to ski tour to the top of Mount St Bathans, but as I
  took my splitbaord off the roof of my car on saturday morning, I realised
  that one of the binding plates was busted, so I ended up walking the whole
  way.</p>

<p>We didn't quite get to the top, instead deciding to take a short cut across
  a bowl just below the main ridge.  We got down to the lovely Boundary Creek
  hut right on darkness, so it was good timing. If we'd gone to the top, we
  would have been there a couple of hours later.</p>

<p>While the weather on saturday had been amazing, apart from some wind up
  high, the forecast for saturday night came true, and we woke up to snow on
  the ground on sunday morning.  It was fortunately an easy walk out to the
  car, and then what was a very interesting drive out on a rough snowy dirt
  road, back to St Bathans for coffee before heading back to Dunedin.</p>
