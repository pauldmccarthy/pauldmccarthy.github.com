Myself and my friend Julian went on a whirlwind trip to Switzerland to climb
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=144206">Motorhead</a>, a
modern classic multi-pitch climb that goes at about E2-E3. The reason that
this climb is so special is its consistency - pretty much any of the 14
pitches would, in isolation, be considered a three-star climb at any crag in
the world.


I have always wanted to visit Switzerland, and during this trip I found myself
reminded of, and pining for, the New Zealand mountains. There just ain't that
much to inspire me in Oxford, when compared to places like this.


Aside from the climbing, perhaps the nicest part of the trip was the constant
noise of cow bells while we were climbing at ... on our last day of the
trip. I'm pretty sure I would be happy to spend the rest of my life with that
noise in the background.
