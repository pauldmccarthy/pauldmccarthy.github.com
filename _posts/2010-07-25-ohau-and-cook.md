This weekend I went to Ohau ski field, to teach myself to ski. My snowboard
gear still hasn't arrived from Australia, and it felt wrong to hire a board (i
want /my/ board), so I hired some skis, and snow-plowed all day. Skiing is
fun, and I might even buy a set of skis, but I don't think I'll ever choose to
ski if boarding is an option.


On sunday, I went to Mt Cook alpine village, and took some photos. I got lucky
with the weather, apparently, although the photos didn't turn out too well,
due to the sun.
