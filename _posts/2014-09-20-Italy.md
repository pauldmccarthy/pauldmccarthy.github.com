During August and September, Claire and I went on a great trip to Northern
Italy. Our plan had been to spend the full three weeks climbing in the
Dolomites, but Italy has apparently had its worst summer in many years, so the
weather forecasts forced us to go on a bit of a road trip.


We went to some lovely areas, including Muzzerone (near the tourist-trap of
Portovenere), Lake Como, and a bunch of areas around Arco, which is something
of a rock climbing mecca.  It's a town of about 15 thousand people, and has
about 10 climbing stores to cater for the needs of the visiting climbers.


We got lucky with the weather for a few days, and managed to climb two peaks
in the Brenta region of the Dolomites - Torre D'ambiez via the East Deirdre,
and Cima Margherita via the classic Detassis Crack. The latter was more
memorable and rewarded us with more spectacular views, but unfortunately I
misplaced my camera just before we made it the base of the route. So I have no
photos of the climb, nor of any others on the second half of the trip. 


Northern Italy is an amazing place. I'd love to go back to re-visit the
amazing Sarca valley (near Arco), to tick off a few more classic Dolomites
climbs and, of course, to drink a bunch of great coffee, and over-indulge on
brioche in the mornings, and pizza in the evenings.
