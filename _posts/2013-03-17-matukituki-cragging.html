I did a lot of climbing on the weekend. We explored some of the lesser visited
crags in the Matukituki valley, west of Wanaka, including the Twilight and
Wishbone walls, and the amazing Pearly Gates. Despite a few incidents
involving local wildlife, and a slightly larger than expected lead fall, it
was a great weekend. Back to work tomorrow.
