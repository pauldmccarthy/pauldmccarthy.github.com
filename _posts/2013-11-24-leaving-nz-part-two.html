<p>On Thursday morning myself and a couple of friends Sam and Steve left
Dunedin for the Darrans.  We drove through drizzle most of the way but had the
weather forecast on our side, and the sky became more blue as we neared our
destination.  We began our adventure with a possibly illegal walk through, and
then climb on, the Homer Tunnel on Thursday night.</p>

<p>On Friday we headed up to Moir's Mate via the intimidating north ridge,
which has seen many parties turn back, and even the
occasional <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6476614/Dead-Fiordland-climber-named">death</a>.
Friday afternoon saw Steve and I climbing Lucky Strike, a fully bolted (more
or less) multi-pitch climb with great moves on great rock. </p>

<p>After spending friday night right at the base of our main objective, on
Saturday we headed up the Bowen Allan Corner. This was a truly memorable climb
- very adventurous, including stiff (for the grade) climbing and intimidating
run-outs on incredible rock, with awe-inspiring views ever present in the
background.  So good, so much fun.</p>

<p>And that was my last trip in New Zealand.  I'm off to Australia for the
rest of 2013, and then (I think) off to the UK for work.  I'll miss this
place, and I hope that I can come back some time in the future.</p>
