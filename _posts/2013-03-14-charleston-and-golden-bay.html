<p>I took some time off work and went on a road trip with a couple of friends.
  We started at Charleston, which is a tiny seaside town on the west coast of
  the south island, known amongst rock climbers as having some of the best
  quality rock in New Zealand.  We then made our way up to Golden Bay at the
  top of the South Island, to check out the limestone sport climbing at
  Payne's Ford.</p>
