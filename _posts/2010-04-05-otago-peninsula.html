Easter Monday began with me struggling to get out of bed. I'd had this ride planned for a few days, but for some reason had decided to go for a 10 km run on sunday, and was really feeling it in my legs, with some particularly nasty shooting pains going down my right shin. It reminded me why I don't like running on the road.  I strongly considered bailiing on the ride, but finally managed to get up around quarter to 9. I cruised down to the supermarket for some supplies, and set off towards the Otago Peninsula at 10:00.  The first leg, a 20 km stretch of flat road from Dunedin to Portobello, was more difficult than I'd expected due to a persistent head wind which just wouldn't let up. The views across the harbour towards Dunedin, however, kept me motivated. I struggled into Portobello at 11:00, had a relaxing coffee, then rode over to the Portobello Peninsula to have a look around.  A side note - according to my GPS, I climbed a total of 94 metres over the entire 20 km section - that's pretty flat.  I had a short and somewhat painful (thanks to my shin), but enjoyable walk around Portobello peninsula, with good views of Quarantine Island, Port Chalmers, and further on up the Otago Peninsula. After a quick poke around the Portobello Aquarium (I found it boring, but kids would like it), I got back on the main road and kept pushing.  The wind had died down a little, so I began enjoying the ride more as the road wound its way towards Taiaroa Head at the top of the peninsula. Again, good views to the west, of Mt Cargill, and of the countryside to the north of Port Chalmers. After a brief, invigorating climb over one final hill, I made it to the Royal Albatross Visitors Centre.  I had a quick walk around, and another coffee, but didn't spend too much time at the centre. There is no 'unguided tour' option, which is fair enough I guess, but the guided tours are a bit expensive. The views from the areas which you can walk around are quite good anyway, although I didn't spot any lesbian albatross.  Upon making it back to Portobello, I was presented with two options; I could either return to Dunedin along the flat coastal road, or I could return via Highcliff road, which would take me through the peninsula hills. Ignoring the pain and fatigue in my legs, I chose the latter. I'd heard that this route had a few steep climbs, although I didn't find it too difficult; I'd say it was probably a little (just a little) easier than riding up Pinnacle road to Mt Wellington, in Hobart. The elevation maxed out at about 310 metres, although total ascent was about 500 metres.  I was glad that I chose the harder route, as I got some epic views over the south of the peninsula, and of the beaches to the east and south. I eventually made my way into the south eastern outskirts of Dunedin, and cruised back into the city.  In total, I rode 67 km in 3:24, which included several 'photo stops' (read: waiting-for-the-pain-in-my-legs-to-subside stops) on the climb up Highcliff.  I really enjoyed this ride, and would love to do it on a roadie; I'll have to buy one soon, as I'll be commuting 26 km every day when I move to Waldronville next week.
