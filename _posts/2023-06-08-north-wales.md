It hasn't rained for around a month in North Wales, and the place has really
come into its own. Everything is dry and, if you're able to ignore the hordes
of weekenders and other various idiots making noise and leaving their rubbish
everywhere, it really is a paradise.

After missing the last two summers due to injury (broken finger in 2021,
dislocated elbow in 2022), I've been very lucky to have had a relatively long
spell without injuring myself, and have been immersing myself in the climbing
around my home in Llanberis.

While it may not be the world's best rock climbing destination, nor have the
world's best weather, North Wales does have an incredible concentration of
rock climbing, and enormous variety of rock types and climbing styles. And to
top it off, there is an amazing community of strong, friendly and active
outdoorsy types.

After having a couple of nasty (but thankfully minor) injuries over the past
few years, I feel like I've become much more aware of the risks associated
with rock climbing, and much less inclined to attempt bold or dangeorous
routes (although I've always been a bit of a wuss, to be honest). But I do
love the thrill of fighting my way up a physically challenging, but well
protected trad climb.

And I've been lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to have
had a few photos taken of me, high up on some classic rock climbs at Dinas
Cromlech.

I'm not sure how long I'll be in North Wales for, but there are definitely
worse places to be, and I'm quite content for the time being.
