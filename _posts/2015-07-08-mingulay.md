A few weeks ago I embarked upon a journey to a remote island in the Outer
Hebrides, west of Scotland, called Mingulay. Known only amongst bird-watchers
and rock climbers, Mingulay has been uninhabited since 1912.


Getting to the island was logistically quite complicated. The first two stages
involved a ten hour drive from Oxford to Oban (with an overnight stop in
Glasgow, and rendevous with a friend, who shared the ride from there), and
five hours on a ferry from Oban to (the aptly named) Castlebay, a tiny town on
the Hebridean island of Barra. Some Scotch whiskey may have been consumed on
the ferry, and may or may not have been paid for by the <a
href="http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/">Climber's Club</a>, a feat achieved by
the amazing [Kyle]({% post_url 2014-07-01-Gogarth %}), who organised the trip,
and evidently managed to squeeze a few pounds out of the CC for slightly
questionable purposes.

We then proceeded to spend around 36 hours stranded in Castlebay, with
horrific weather making it too dangerous for Donald the boatman to take us
across. Eventually though, we boarded the Boy James and putted along for
around an hour to finally reach the beautiful Mingulay bay, our home for the
following week. The entirety of this journey, by the way, was accomplished
whilst lugging around climbing and camping gear, and food for a week.

In addition to occasional groups of climbers over the summer months, Mingulay
hosts an abundance of wildlife. A colony of what must have been a thousand
seals (the population varied on a daily basis) was settled just a few hundred
metres from our campsite, at the far end of the bay. Just beyond them was a
colony of puffins, who seemed to enjoy flying around in circles for hours on
end. While climbing, we did our best to avoid many other species of birds
living on the sea cliffs (wildlife photos courtesy of my climbing partner
for the week Joris Roulleau, a friendly Frenchman who is a much better
photographer, and has a much better camera, than I).

In particular, throughout the week Joris and I tried and failed to develop a
successful Bonxie (a.k.a Great Skua) avoidance strategy. During my week on
Mingulay I came to the conclusion that bonxies are stupid, aggressive
arseholes. They lay their eggs on the ground out in the open, and make no
attempt to hide them. When anything (human; rabbit; another bird; nothing much
else exists on Mingulay) comes within about 50 metres of them, they abandon
their egg and start swooping at the intruder. We took to carrying around
bonxie sticks whenever we travelled through their territory.

Anyway, back to the topic of climbing; once we arrived on the island we had
amazing weather for pretty much the whole week, so were able to climb every
day bar one.  We spent the first few days exploring the cliffs in the North
West, climbing <a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=103777">The
Arch Deacon</a> on the first day, and then heading over to the Boulevard on
the second. On our first day here we abseiled down at the wrong spot,
and accidentally climbed what turned out to be a worthwhile new line (a variant
of <a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=125632">this one</a>)
which went at about E1. We soon oriented ourselves and spent the next two days
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=103108">ticking</a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=103109">off</a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=95190">several</a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=103462">great</a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=103464">climbs</a> - the
Boulevard is a top-notch crag.

We spent the remainder of the week at the awe-inspiring Dun Mingulay. On the
fourth day of the trip, Joris and I quickly discovered why pretty much
everyone else on the trip had gone straight to this cliff, instead of poking
around on the smaller crags. It is an incredible place with immaculate rock,
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=60776">some </a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=60777">amazing</a>
<a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=60774">climbs</a> (the
last two have to be some of my best climbing experiences to date), and an
atmosphere second to none.  This cliff was really what made the trip worth it
for me, and what would make me strongly consider returning to Mingulay.

Mingulay is a very special place. I was lucky to get the opportunity to go
there, and on top of that, go there with such an amazing group of people.
