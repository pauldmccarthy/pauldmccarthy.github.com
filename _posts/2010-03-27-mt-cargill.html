I've been in Dunedin for a week now. I'm still staying at the backpackers, as I've found it difficult to find a place to live, although I'm being quite picky. Anyway, I had to get out for a while, and have a break from the stresses of doing nothing all day.  So today I decided to search for some single track around Dunedin. The Kennett Brothers recommend Forrester Park and Bethunes Gully; I figured they'd make a nice loop from the city. Upon reaching Forrester, I was informed that the entire park was closed for BMX races, so I headed straight to Bethunes Gully, and started climbing up the Mt Cargill walk way.  I spotted a bunch of tempting single tracks leading off the main walk way in each direction, but decided to keep climbing; the track mentioned in the book was supposed to start about a kilometre along the walk way, and was supposed to be signposted. I evidently missed this turnoff, and before I knew it, found myself halfway to the Mt Cargill summit. It turned out to be a brutal climb to 680 metres - almost an hour straight in lowest gear - a good work out.  It was a clear day, so I got good views of Dunedin, Otago Peninsula, and the Silverpeak mountains (which I'll be visiting soon) to the north. I headed over to Butters Peak nearby, then did some scrambling up the Organ Pipes. I eventually found my way onto Mt Cargill road, and had an enjoyable descent back into Dunedin - I averaged about 55 km/h most of the way back down.
