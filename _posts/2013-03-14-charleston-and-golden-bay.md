I took some time off work and went on a road trip with a couple of friends.
We started at Charleston, which is a tiny seaside town on the west coast of
the south island, known amongst rock climbers as having some of the best
quality rock in New Zealand.  We then made our way up to Golden Bay at the
top of the South Island, to check out the limestone sport climbing at
Payne's Ford.
