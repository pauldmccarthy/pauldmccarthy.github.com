I recently had a great few days climbing around Queenstown and
Wanaka. Unfortunately i dropped my camera whilst rappelling down from the Lake
Alta slabs, up on the Remarkables ski field. I watched in bemused horror as it
clattered down the slab, eventually coming to rest 50 metres below me. The
body escaped in one piece, but batteries and SD card were nowhere to be
found. Oh well, easy come easy go.

No photos, obviously. Instead, here's some photos of the beloved Mitsuca, and
one of the wire which saved me from a potentially nasty fall in Wanaka a few
days later.
