On sunday I decided to tempt fate and head back in to the silver peaks. It was
a much more relaxing trip this time, involving an easy 7 hour walk around Gap
Ridge and Yellow Ridge. The walk was quite varied, with ridge top walking
through tussock and prickly gorse, and walking through native and plantation
forests.
