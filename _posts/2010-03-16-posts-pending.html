I've been on a number of bushwalks over the past week or so, notwithstanding
Mount Anne in the Southwest of Tasmania, where I lost my camera. I'm still in
the process of trying to track it down. If you've seen it, please give me a
yell. It's the one which has pictures of me standing on the summit, looking
tired and dishevelled.


I've moved to New Zealand; I'm currently drinking wine at a backpackers in
Christchurch; internet is hard to come by, so I've got a few sets of photos
that I'll be able to upload when I find a decent place with wireless internet.
