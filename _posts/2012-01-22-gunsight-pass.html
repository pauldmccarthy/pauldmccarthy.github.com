Last weekend, with a group of friends, I did the North-South Temple Valley circuit, heading over Gunsight Pass. The first day was a bit longer than expected at about 13 hours, but the weather held out, and we steadily made our way over the pass, reaching the South Temple hut before dark, at around 9pm. On sunday, we headed back out via the South Temple.  This is a great option for a weekend trip, with amazing views, a comfortable hut, and travel over really diverse terrain, including boulder and scree fields, river beds, forest trails and alpine scrub. The only downside is the excess of sandflies, but not much can be done about that.
