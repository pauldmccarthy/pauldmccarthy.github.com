Mount Arapiles is the home of traditional climbing in Australia. Only 350km
from Melbourne, and around 450km from Adelaide, it is very accessible, and has
thouands of routes. I squeezed in a few days there whilst on a trip back home,
meeting up with my friend Steven, who was staying there for a couple of
weeks. We met up in Horsham, picked up some supplies, and headed out to the
crag.


We concentrated on the longer lines, doing a few 100+ metre routes, including
the amazing Watchtower Crack (last picture). It was a good chance for me to
solidify my skill and confidence in gear placement and anchoring. I also
learnt a valuable lesson in multi-pitch climbing: wear comfortable shoes!
