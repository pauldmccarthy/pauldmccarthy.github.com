<p>On the Easter weekend, I headed up to Manchester to catch up with a couple
of friends from NZ, <a href"http://www.k-boomhouse.com/">Chris</a>
and <a href="http://chantelleboom.blogspot.co.uk/">Chantelle</a> (credit to
them for the last two pics). We had a great few days enjoying the sun in North
Wales (I presume it's always sunny up there), and checking out a couple of
climbing areas.</p>
