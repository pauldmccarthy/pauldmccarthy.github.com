A slightly belated post ... about a month ago, I went on a great trip with a
few friends up to the Isles of Lewis and Harris, for our Outer Hebridean fix
(now seemingly an [annual]({% post_url 2015-07-08-mingulay%})
event). Despite having two names, Lewis and Harris are actually the same
island. They are, however, geologically separate - Lewis is a bleak, glacier
swept landscape with thousands of lochs; whereas Harris is more mountainous in
nature.


Anyway, despite the fact that Lewis/Harris are in Scotland, the weather was
great - we had sunshine for most of the week and, more importantly, did not
see a single midge. Good times.


The climbing on Lewis is great (we didn't end up getting anything done on
Harris). Lewisian gneiss (nice!) - a granite-like rock which is some of the
oldest rock in Europe, and maybe the world (I'm not sure if this is entirely
true - you'll have to look that up). Mostly single pitch climbing on sea
cliffs. Great rock, great protection, great scenery.


But I don't think I'll remember this trip for the climbing. I have been
telling everyone (not just climbers) that they must visit Lewis and Harris -
it's such an amazing part of the world; you'll feel like you're thousands of
miles away from your everyday life. It's a beautiful place.
