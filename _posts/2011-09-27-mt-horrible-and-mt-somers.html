I had a great weekend climbing with a couple of friends. We started at Mt Horrible on saturday for a bit of trad, then drove up to Mt Somers, and hiked for 2.5 hours up to Pinnacles Hut. 5cm of snow settled overnight, but we woke to beautiful blue skies, so did a few sport climbs on the nearest crag. The snow returned around 2pm, so we packed up and headed back down the hill.
