<p>On the weekend we headed up Whale Stream, just off Lake Pukaki on the way
  to Mount Cook. We had hoped to climb 'Fluke', a classic rock route on
  Ferintosh Peak (the first high peak on the left, in the seventh picture),
  but we weren't too happy with the amount of snow on the route (which had all
  fallen over the course of a few hours on the previous day), and the
  sub-freezing conditions on saturday night which would have meant ice and
  verglas on the rock. So it ended up being a pleasant hike, despite carrying
  a 60 metre rope and a trad rack all the way.</p>

<p>But what a beautiful valley - I'm really surprised that it's not a more
  popular place to go tramping. The views were amazing, and we found a perfect
  campsite only 10 minutes from the base of our intended route (it became
  perfect after we spent 30 minutes making a clearing). On sunday we got up
  early and wandered along the ridge towards Ferintosh, getting some great
  views into the surrounding valleys. </p>
