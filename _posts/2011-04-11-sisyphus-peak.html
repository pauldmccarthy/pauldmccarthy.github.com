This weekend, I went into the East Matukituki with a small group, with the aim
of climbing Sisyphus Peak. We enjoyed good weather, and amazing views for the
entire trip.On saturday, we had planned to head up to Wilmot Saddle, at 1682
metres. We found a nice campsite around 1500 metres, however, so decided to
settle in for a relaxing night. The more enthusiastic of the group were up at
5am on Sunday to tackle the climb up Sisyphus. It was an exciting scramble
through the dark to Wilmot Saddle, and then a short but steep climb up
Sisyphus, where we were treated to sunrise over the Aspiring ranges, and fog
spewing out from the Volta Glacier. Heading back down to the carpark
afterwards, an impressive rainbow formed over Rainbow Stream. I'm assuming
it's a common occurrence.
