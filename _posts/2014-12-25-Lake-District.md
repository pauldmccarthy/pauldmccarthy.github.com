The mountains in the Lake District of Northern England may be small, but
they've got attitude. Claire and I spent a few days over Christmas doing a few
hikes in fresh snow and great weather.


We did a couple of lovely loops, both ridge traverses. The first started and
finished at a tiny village called Little Langdale, and took us around the cirque
beneath Wetherlam, Swirl How, and the Great Carrs. The second was at a village
called Buttermere (by the lake of the same name), up Red Pike, over High Stile
and High Crag, and back down to the village.


I do like the names they give to mountains and hills in the UK. Very poetic.
