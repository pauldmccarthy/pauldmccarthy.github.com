<p>On the weekend I climbed a rock route called 'Bedazzled' on the Dasler
Pinnacles with a friend. We left Dunedin on friday afternoon, and my
trusty-but-not-really-a-4WD subaru made it all the way to Monument hut without
difficulty. It was a hard slog up to the base of the pinnacles on saturday,
carrying a rope, trad rack, and 4 litres of water - we weren't sure if we'd
have a water supply, so played it safe and took our own. We ended up finding a
beautiful camp site 10 minutes walk from the base, with a stream right next to
the camp (this would probably dry up in late summer/autumn). The pinnacles
were busy, with two groups planning to hit the north ridge in the morning (I
knew three people in the valley - NZ is a very small place). We had the west
face to ourselves, however.</p>

<p>We had originally planned to climb a different route, 'Fly Wheel', but the
approach didn't look very nice, so we settled on Bedazzled. Up at 5am for
coffee and breakfast, we started the climb at 7am. Most of it involved easy
scrambling (maybe maximum grade 10) on poor quality rock; on these sections
you would need to be happy with loose rock, big run outs, and a lack of good
gear placements. Between the choss were two amazing pitches on top quality
rock, at about grade 15; I got lucky and had the lead on these.</p>

<p>You can see the line in the third photo - we may not have followed the
original route for the first couple of pitches, but eventually managed to
traverse across on to the buttress. The best pitch was the white face just to
the right of the shady corner - about 30 metres of steep solid rock with a
couple of finger sized cracks that had great gear. The other good pitch was
about 50 metres above this white face.</p>

<p>We climbed about 250 metres over 7 pitches, and then took the rope off and
scrambled the remaining 150 or so metres to the top. Then we scooted down the
north ridge, packed up the tent, and raced back to the car for an 8pm
departure. A great weekend which has given me a slight taste for mountain rock
routes. Hopefully I'll fit in a couple more before the summer is over.</p>

<p>With the imminent closure of Posterous, I'll be moving this blog elsewhere
in the next few weeks. Not yet sure where it'll end up ...</p>
