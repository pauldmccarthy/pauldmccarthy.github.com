<p>A slightly belated post, but I've since moved halfway across the world, and
unfortunately we just didn't take that many photos.</p>

<p>Just before moving over to Oxford, where there is no climbing whatsoever,
Claire and I managed to fit in a great trip to the Blue Mountains, NSW's
international climbing destination. We had originally planned to go to the
Grampians, but as they were literally on fire as I drove past, we drove for an
extra day to set up camp at the Blueys.</p>

<p>Even though I say this about every place I visit, I swear that the Blue
Mountains is a must-visit destination if you're a climber, and you're in
Australia. Every style of climbing is catered for. Single- and multi-pitch
sport and trad, with every grade covered, in a beautiful setting, with free
camping and great bakeries to boot!</p>

<p>It's been a while since the trip, but the climb which stands out the most
in my memory was on the last day, before we started the long drive back to
Victoria (and then back to Adelaide for me). After some discussion, we decided
to attempt Clockwork Orange, a classic 2-3 pitch trad climb at the Shipley
Lower crag. </p>

<p>After some initial hesitation at the dubious rock quality, Claire
breezed up the first pitch, a lovely grade 18. Then I linked the top two
pitches, the first an amazing grade 20 which made its way up an overhanging
corner crack. Loads of gear, and loads of good holds, it was my kind of
climb. The top pitch provided a sting in the tail however. Given grade 15 in
the guide book, we both found it incredibly stiff. I swear that there were a
few moves at grade 18-19, well above my last piece of gear.</p>

<p>So even though we didn't take many photos, and the ones we took were a bit
rubbish, this was a trip that I'll remember for a long time.</p>
