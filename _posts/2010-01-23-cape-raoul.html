Today I walked to Cape Raoul, on the Tasman Peninsula. I had previously tried the walk about 18 months ago, but early on in the walk, lost the track and couldn't continue. I realised today that the track is ridiculously easy to follow, so I felt pretty stupid about failing on my previous attempt.  The walk is reasonably straightforward, heading straight out towards the cape through dense scrub, and then along the cliff. Upon descending onto the cape the wind really starts to howl. I'm not sure if it's always like this, but strong winds are supposed to be quite common.  There are some stunning views of the Tasman National Park to the East, and Shipstern Bluff, and the rest of the Peninsula to the West. The South West peaks could be clearly seen in the fine weather.  The walk took about four and a half hours, which included several photo breaks.
