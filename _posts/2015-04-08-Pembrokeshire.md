Claire and I spent the Easter weekend climbing in Pembrokeshire, one of the
UK's best climbing destinations. I quickly discovered why - the rock in
Pembroke is extremely high quality, the atmosphere second to none, and the
climbing full value. There are some minor downsides, such as the tides, the
Easter weekend crowds, the bird nesting restrictions, and random pieces of
potentially explosive debris from military training, but these are all worth
the hassle of climbing on (arguably) some of the best sea cliffs in the world.

barely touched the surface of what was available. There are thousands of
climbs waiting for our next trip.
