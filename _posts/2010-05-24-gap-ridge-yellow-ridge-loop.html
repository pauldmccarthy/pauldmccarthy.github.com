On sunday I decided to tempt fate and head back in to the silver peaks. It was a much more relaxing trip this time, involving an easy 7 hour walk around Gap Ridge and Yellow Ridge. The walk was quite varied, with ridge top walking through tussock and prickly gorse, and walking through native and plantation forests.
