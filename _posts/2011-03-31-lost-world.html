I had a free day in Hobart before flying back to Dunedin, so went on a hike. I
parked at The Springs, and headed straight over to Lost World, probably my
favourite place on the mountain. I quickly lost the markers leading the way,
but knew where I was going, so bush-bashed my way up to the cliffs. There was
a slight incident, where I mistakenly attempted to use a basketball-sized rock
as a hand hold; it proceeded to roll forwards, causing me to fall down a few
metres into trees. Fortunately, the rock decided not to follow me down, so no
harm done.


From Lost World, I headed up to the summit via the Panorama track, where I was
greeted with hail and a vicious south-westerly. I had planned to head over the
plateau to the Icehouse track, but the weather would have been
horrendous. Instead, I ran over to the start of the zig-zag track and made my
way back down out of the wind.  Photos taken with a 'MITSUCA DIGITAL CAMERA',
given to me by a friend who won it at a fancy dress party. I'm debating
whether to buy an SLR; it's probably not a good idea given my track record.
