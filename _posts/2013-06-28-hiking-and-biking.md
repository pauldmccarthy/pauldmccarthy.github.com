I've had a couple of good weekends. Last week, I went on a couple of day
hikes around Wanaka with a few friends. The first day involved show-shoeing
along Grandview range, near Lake Hawea, and the second an easy walk up to
the highest point above Diamond Lake.


The weekend just gone was all about mountain biking. On saturday we headed
up the Mount Ida water race which, despite an unrelenting wind, numerous
river crossings, and having to sidle around a watery 'vortex', was great
fun. Then on sunday we had a blast on the single track around Naseby.
