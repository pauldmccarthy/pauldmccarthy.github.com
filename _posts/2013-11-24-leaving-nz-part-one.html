<p>I've submitted my PhD, and am unfortunately about to leave New Zealand.  So
over the past week I've been trying to cram in as much outdoorsy stuff as
possible during my remaining time in this beautiful country.</p>

<p>On Sunday, my friend Sam and I left Dunedin around 7:30am, and drove to the
start of the Dart valley, a couple of hours north of Queenstown. We climbed
(most of) a classic rock route called Ravages of Time.  We started climbing
around 3pm and made it to the bottom of the final pitch at 8:30pm.  But that
was our pre-designated cut-off time, so we decided to head down, in order to
get the complex parts of the descent over before dark.  We made it back to our
stashed beer around 10:30pm, and back to the car around 12am.  Awesome climb.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of days we climbed at Kingston, and had an amazing day
up at the Sundial, probably the most photogenic crag I have ever visited.</p>
