Today, I walked up to Adamsons Peak in South West Tasmania, a return trip of
about 10-15 km, with 1000 metres total ascent.  The first section of the walk
climbs steeply through moderately dense forest up to a plateau which lies east
of the summit. It was quite a hot day, so by the time I made it to the
plateau, I was drenched with sweat. This part of the walk was quite tedious,
as it took almost 2 hours with no scenery for the entire
duration. Additionally, the heat and the gradient took their toll on me.


Nevertheless, the views from the plateau quickly made me forget about the
climb. Gorgeous views of the Huon and Bruny Island back to the East, and the
Adamsons summit to the west kept me entertained on the approach.  The plateau
was quite overgrown and muddy; my legs were quite badly scratched from pushing
through the bracken, and on more than one occasion my feet sunk up to half a
foot into the mud. I suppose that it rains quite frequently, and a day as hot
as today is quite rare in this area, so the track must remain perpetually
muddy.


The final ascent to the summit took a little longer than I expected. It looked
deceptively close as I approached from the plateau, but I ended up taking
nearly 1.5 hours to reach the top.  The views of the south west from the
summit were breathtaking; I would have loved to have spent more time up there,
but it was very hot, and I'd forgotten to bring sun cream, so I took my
photos, had a bite to eat and started back down. I completed the return
journey fairly quickly, getting back to the car after a total time of about 5
hours 40 minutes.
