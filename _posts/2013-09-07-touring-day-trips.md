I've given up on weekend trips until my PhD has been submitted. So I've
been making the most of the ski fields which are accessible as a day trip from
Dunedin. Last week I had a great time traversing the ridge which surrounds Mt
Dobson ski field (first pic).


Yesterday I had an amazing day trip to Awakino with a group of friends. The
field is closed and, bar a miracle dump of snow, will probably stay that way
for the rest of the year. But if you're willing to hike, there are some
fantastic runs to be had. We found a beautiful gully south of the ski field,
which provided us with an uninterrupted 2 kilometre run down. And then an
entertaining walk back up another gully - I'm glad I had an ice axe!
