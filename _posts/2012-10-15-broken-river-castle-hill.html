The allure of a snow storm brought me to Canterbury for the weekend. A fantastic couple of days including night skiing in the best powder snow you'll ever see in NZ, at Broken River ski field, and bouldering at Castle Hill in blue bird sky weather on sunday, after the storm had passed. Mid October 2012, New Zealand.
