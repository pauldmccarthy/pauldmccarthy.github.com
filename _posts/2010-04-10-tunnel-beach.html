Today, on my way home from the city, I stopped in at Tunnel Beach, a local landmark only about 6 km from Waldronville. A short walk from the carpark provides stunning views of the sandstone shoreline, slowly being eroded by the wind and waves.  Tunnel Beach gets its name from the man-made tunnel that provides access to the beach itself; it was built around 1870 by a politician so he and his family could enjoy private access to the beach.
